## Boolean Identities

XOR Identities:
$$
\bar A B + A \bar B = A \oplus B \\
(\bar A + \bar B) 
$$



$$
ABC = A(BC)\\
\overline{ABC} = \bar A + \overline{BC} = \bar A  + \overline{B} \\
$$

## Inside the kits

insert/remove micro usb: hold finger over port

for chips, usually an indicator on the corner where it's pin 1

pins go anticlockwise

bottom right is gnd, top left is vcc (+5V)

don't have wires over IC, minimise as much as possible

## schematic diagrams

draw before constructing circuit

more than just a logic diagrams

contains:

- labelled inputs
- labelled outputs
- labelled devices (logic chips, io board)
  - give each device a unique name
    - logic chips: U1, U2, ..
    - gates within a chip: `:A`, `:B`, `:C` ,etc.

inputs look like arrows
