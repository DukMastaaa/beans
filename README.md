notes for various subjects from school/uni

## Uni Courses
- INFS1200
- CSSE2010

## School Subjects
- Maths B
- Maths C

I use typora to write some notes, so there are embedded latex and diagrams that Github's Markdown doesn't render.
Images should render properly because they are stored in a `./images` folder relative to the Markdown file.
