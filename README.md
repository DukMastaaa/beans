I use [Typora](https://typora.io/) to write Markdown so some files have LaTeX and [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) diagrams
that Github's Markdown doesn't render. Images should render as they are stored in a `./images` folder relative to the Markdown file, but
will take up the width of the whole screen in Github's viewer.
